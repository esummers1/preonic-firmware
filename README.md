# Preonic Keyboard Firmware

This is made using the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/).

## Setup

Install [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) in order to flash firmware.

Note that on macOS, the keyboard locale must be "British - PC". This will swap the backtick and backslash keys, but allow you to access the Â£ sign (!).
