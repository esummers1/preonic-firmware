# Preonic Keyboard Firmware

This is made using the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/).

## Setup

Install [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) in order to flash firmware.

It can be difficult to get macOS to use the correct layout with the Preonic. When prompted, make sure to choose ISO, and check that the backtick key enters a backtick. If it enters a backslash, the keyboard preferences must be removed by hand and the keyboard re-registered as ISO - pressing backslash during the left-shift prompt, **not** backtick!.
